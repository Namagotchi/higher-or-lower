# higher-or-lower
my first python program that i horribly made for one of my classes in uni

run this file on an IDE that uses python, or run this command in command prompt/terminal if you have python installed:

***For Windows/macOS/Linux:***
1. cd [type in or copy/paste the directory where the file is located]
2. py higherorlower.py, python higherorlower.py, or python3 higherorlower.py (i use python 3.10.4)
3. play the game!
